    <p>Once upon a time and a very good time it was there was
a moocow coming down along the road and this moocow
that was coming down along the road met a nicens little boy
named baby tuckoo...<br/>
His father told him that story: his father looked at him
through a glass: he had a hairy face.<br/>
He was baby tuckoo. The moocow came down the road
where Betty Byrne lived: she sold lemon platt.</p>
    <pre><em>
    O, the wild rose blossoms
    On the little green place. 
    </em></pre>
    <p>He sang that song. That was his song.</p>
    <pre><em>
    O, the green wothe botheth. 
    </em></pre>
    <p>When you wet the bed first it is warm then it gets cold.
His mother put on the oilsheet. That had the queer smell.<br/>
His mother had a nicer smell than his father. She played
on the piano the sailorâ€™s hornpipe for him to dance. He
danced:</p>
    <pre><em>
    Tralala lala,
    Tralala tralaladdy,
    Tralala lala,
    Tralala lala. 
    </em></pre>

    <p><sup>1</sup>This line from Ovid's (a big shot Roman poet from the 1st century CE) Latin poem translates to, "And he applied his spirit to obscure arts." This "he" is Daedalus, a master craftsman who appears in Greek and Roman mythology.
